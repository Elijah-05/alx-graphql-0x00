## 🧩 About
The **Episode Query** project focuses on retrieving detailed information about specific episodes from the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).  
It demonstrates how to use GraphQL queries with arguments to fetch targeted data for individual episodes by their unique ID.

Each query retrieves essential details about an episode, including:
- **id** – Unique identifier of the episode  
- **name** – Title of the episode  
- **air_date** – Original release date of the episode  
- **episode** – Episode code (e.g., S01E01)

This project highlights GraphQL’s strength in structured, precise data retrieval — enabling developers to access only the information they need through a single, efficient query.
