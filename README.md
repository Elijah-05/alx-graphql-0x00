# alx-graphql-0x00

## üß© Overview

This project serves as a complete example of a modern GraphQL-powered web application.  
It showcases how to:

- Fetch and paginate data from a GraphQL API using precise and efficient queries.  
- Integrate GraphQL seamlessly into a **Next.js** and **TypeScript** frontend using **Apollo Client**.  
- Build reusable, type-safe **React components**.  
- Manage state, caching, and data loading through Apollo‚Äôs client-side capabilities.  
- Design responsive and elegant user interfaces using **Tailwind CSS**.

The application connects to the **Rick and Morty GraphQL endpoint**, displaying detailed information about characters, episodes, and related entities ‚Äî making the learning experience both fun and practical.

## üß† Key Concepts
- **GraphQL Query Language:** Fetch structured data from a single flexible endpoint.  
- **Schema and Types:** Uses the Rick and Morty API‚Äôs defined types such as `Character`, `Episode`, and `Info`.  
- **Arguments and Pagination:** Supports filtering and paginating data using arguments like `id` and `page`.  
- **Apollo Client Integration:** Handles queries, caching, and error management within React components.  
- **TypeScript Safety:** Provides static typing and better developer experience with clear interfaces.  
- **Modern Frontend Stack:** Combines **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** for performance and maintainability.
